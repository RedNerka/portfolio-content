                        11 Bit Studios is a game development company founded in September 11, 2010. The company is located in Poland. In their official website, they give video games a completely different definition from the conventional idea.
                        "We consider games to be a form of storytelling. Our games expand on this by offering ambiguous choices, evoking emotions that have been reserved for other forms, tackling topics not previously seen in games, and simply looking for new ways to offer worthwhile experiences."
                        And indeed, This War of Mine, as one of the most well-known games produced by 11 Bit Studios, has depicted war from a brand new angle, namely, from a civilian's view.

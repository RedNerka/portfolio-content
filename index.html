                <h2>Background Story</h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration of This War of Mine comes from the Siege of Sarajevo, 1992-1996. In the game, a ficitonal city called Pogoren was under siege because of a civil war. 
                    Besides the government army and the rebellion army, a large number of civilians were trapped in the city.

                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <p>
                    While the army had sufficient supplies, most of the civilian had few supplies and little combat training.
                    Players will control three or four civilians, and the ultimate goal is to keep them alive.
                    There are three main modes of gameplay, including scavenging for supplies, reinforcing the shelter, and combating.
                </p>
                <h3>Scavenge for Supplies</h3>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    In the nights, player will control one character to go out for supplies. Each character has a different backpack capacity. So, planning what to take, and what not to take will influence the chance of survival significantly.
                </p>
                <h3>Reinforce the Shelter</h3>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/reinforce.png" alt="Player should reinforce the shelter."/>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Characters stay in the shelter during the day to avoid being shot by army snipers. During the day, they need to use whatever they have to reinforce the shelter, to make the shelter a place to live.
                    Besides, eating, keeping the rooms warm and stabilizing the characters' mood are all important. Be aware, starving, low temperature and depressed mood will affect the characters' work efficiency and even their lives.
                </p>
                <h3>Combat if Necessary</h3>
                <figure>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    You are not the only one who go out at night. The people you meet outside the shelter can be friendly, mutual or hostile, depending on your behavior and their own thoughts.
                    Arm yourself and be prepare for inevitable combat and the possible invasion to your shelter.
